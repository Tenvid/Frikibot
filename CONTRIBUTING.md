# Contribution guide

## General guidelines

Code must be formatted following the Ruff rules specified in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

All Pull Requests must be directed to `dev` branch.

## How to contribute

1. Make a fork from GitHub
2. Clone your repo locally
3. Make your changes in a new branch
4. Push changes to your repo
5. Open a Pull Request

## Did you find a bug?

Make sure that your bug is not present in any pull request or issue and then
create a new issue using the "Bug Report" template.

## Do you have a great idea for a new feature?

Make sure that your suggestion is not present in any pull request or issue and then you can create an issue with the template "Feature request" or create a Pull request explaining your implementation.

> Making a Pull Request does not mean that it will be merged.

## Do you want to mantain code?

You are free to make Pull Requests improving formatting, docstrings explanations, adding docstrings... But the style rules in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) must not change.

If a user wants to modify style rules, it has to be done justified by an issue.
